### Week 4 code examples

**Table Save**
- in the previous two table examples, the checked state was NOT saved
- in this example, the checked state IS saved 
- this supports a re-draw task, after a row moves off the screen, and then returns

**Alert Action** 
– modal view controllers, UIAlert, UIActionSheet

**To Do Add** 
– get started with the ‘add item’ pattern; NSArray is the data store

**Fav Photo** 
– use a Cocoa-provided modal view controller (a photo picker)

**Tab Intro** 
– get started with a multi-view app controlled by a ‘tab bar’

**Nav Views** 
– introduction to navigation-based apps (i.e. ‘drill down’)

**Nav Colors** 
- master-detail, using a table view to drive the navigation actions
